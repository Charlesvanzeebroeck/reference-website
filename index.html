    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the appearance of web pages. It is used to define the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a web page.
</p>
<p>
    To implement CSS to an HTML file, you can either use inline CSS, internal CSS, or external CSS. External CSS is the preferred method as it allows for better organization and separation of concerns. To link an external CSS file to an HTML file, use the following code in the head section of the HTML file: < link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</p>
<p>
    CSS property vs. value:
CSS properties are used to define the style of an HTML element, while values are used to specify the specific styling details. For example:
font-family: Arial;
In this example, font-family is the property, and Arial is the value.
